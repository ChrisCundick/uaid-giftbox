## Setting Up a Working Environment
In order to set up a working environment for this repository you will need a Wamp server and a WordPress installation. Setup instructions are detailed below.

### Getting Started With Wamp
Go to [wampserver.com/en](wampserver.com/en) and follow the steps below:

1. Click "Download" in the navigation bar.
2. Click the option that is most appropriate for your computer (32 or 64-bit options).
3. Click "download directly". You will be redirected to Sourceforge and your download will begin.
4. Go through the installation process (You may want to customize where the Wamp folder will be installed, but it isn't necessary).
5. After installation you may get a security alert. Allow Apache HTTP Server to communicate on private networks.
6. Wamp will also ask about PHP mail parameters. Leave these set to the default values for now.

After installation, your server will be running. If not, you can start it by:

* double clicking the desktop shortcut if you created one in installation
* searching "Wamp" in the start menu, and selecting the program

Open a browser and type in "localhost". If your server is running it will open a page with the Wamp logo. The localhost runs from the "www" folder in your Wamp installation.

To stop the server, right click the Wamp icon in the taskbar (bottom right) and click "Exit".

### Installing WordPress
Go to [wordpress.org](wordpress.org) and follow the steps below:

1. Click "Download WordPress" in the navigation bar.
2. Click "Download WordPress X.X".
3. Extract the files into the "www" folder in your Wamp installation.
4. Open your browser to "localhost/<wordpress-folder-name>".
5.
